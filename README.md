# Climate data analysis with Python -- a tutorial of the very first steps.

Example notebook showcasing how climate data can be opened and worked with using Python. This is an entry level illustration for newcomers. 

The notebook will be available on binder:

The climate data itself (available in `data`) is downloaded from ESGF (https://esgf-metagrid.cloud.dkrz.de/search) and is only available due to the fantastic work of the Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and the developers of the particular model used here (CESM).
